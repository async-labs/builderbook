### Our Book

In our book, we teach you how to build this web app from scratch - with [individual codebases](https://github.com/builderbook/book-1-code) for every chapter. We wrote the book using this web app.

#### Who this book is for

Our book is ideal for junior developers who want to learn how to build a web app from scratch. 

You should know fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience with React is helpful but not a must-have.

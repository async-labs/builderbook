## Builder Book

Open source web app to self-publish and sell books or other online content (`builderbook` directory of this repository). If you are book's reader, you will work `book` directory.

We've used this `builderbook` project to build:
- [Builder Book](https://builderbook.org) - learn how to build full-stack web apps from scratch
- [SaaS Boilerplate](https://github.com/async-labs/saas) - open source web app to build your own SaaS product
- [Async](https://async-await.com) - team communication tool for software developers

## Live app:
- https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction.

## What can I learn from this project?

You will learn how to structure your project and build many internal and external API infrastructures.

On the browser, the main technologies you will learn are: Next.js, React.js, Material-UI.
On the server, the main technologies you will learn are: Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js, MongoDB database.

In addition to the above technologies, you can learn how to integrate your web application with the following external API services:
- Google OAuth API
- Github API
- Stripe API
- AWS SES API
- Mailchimp API

Plus, you can learn many concepts such as `session` and `cookie`, headers, HTTP request-response, Express middleware, `Promise`, `async/await`, and more. You have to know these concepts to be a confident web developer, no matter what language you use.

The main use cases for this project, besides learning, are:
- To write and host free documentation with Github being a source of truth for content.
- To sell online content, such as books.
- To extend it (see our second book, SaaS Boilerplate Book) to start software business.

## Run locally
- Clone the project and run `yarn` to add packages.
- Before you start the app, create a `.env` file at the app's root. This file must have values for some env variables specified below.
  - To get `MONGO_URL_TEST`, we recommend a [free MongoDB at MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/) (to be updated soon with MongoDB Atlas, see [issue](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/issues/138)).
  - Get `GOOGLE_CLIENTID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET` by following [official OAuth tutorial](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#before_you_begin).

    Important: For Google OAuth app, callback URL is: http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback <br/>
    Important: You have to enable Google+ API in your Google Cloud Platform account.

  - Specify your own secret key for Express session `SESSION_SECRET`: https://github.com/expressjs/session#secret


To use all features and third-party integrations (such as Stripe, Google OAuth, Mailchimp), add values for all of the following env variables in your `.env` file:

  `.env` :
  ```
  # Used in server/server.js
  MONGO_URL=
  MONGO_URL_TEST=
  SESSION_SECRET=

  # Used in lib/getRootUrl.js
  URL_APP=
  PRODUCTION_URL_APP=

  # Used in server/google.js
  GOOGLE_CLIENTID=
  GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET=

  # Used in server/aws.js
  AWS_ACCESSKEYID=

  MAILCHIMP_PURCHASED_LIST_ID=
  MAILCHIMP_SIGNEDUP_LIST_ID=

  # Used in pages/_document.js and pages/_app.js
  GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=
  COOKIE_DOMAIN=

  ```

- Start the app with `yarn dev`.
  - To get `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`, set up Google Analytics and follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) to find your tracking ID.
  - To get Stripe-related API keys, set up or log into your Stripe account and find your key [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys).
- Env keys `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` and `STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLEKEY`/`STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLEKEY` are universally available (client and server). Env keys inside `.env` file are used in server code only. To make env vars universally available, add them to `next.config.js` file.
- To make user a book's owner, set `"isAdmin": true` on corresponding MongoDB document in your database (default value is `false` for any new user).

**Important: if you don't add values for environmental variables to `.env` file, corresponding functionality will not work. For example, login with Google account, purchasing book, getting repo information via GitHub API and other third-party API infrastructures.**


## Add a new book
- Create a new Github repo (public or private).
- In that repo, create an `introduction.md` file and write some content.
- At the top of your `introduction.md` file, add metadata in the format shown below. See [this file](https://github.com/builderbook/demo-book/blob/master/introduction.md) as an example.
  
  ```
  ---
  title: Introduction
  seoTitle: title for search engines
  seoDescription: description for search engines
  isFree: true
  ---
  ```

- Go to the app, click "Connect Github".
- Click "Add Book". Enter details and select the Github repo you created.
- Click "Save".

When you add new `.md` files or update content, go to the `BookDetail` page of your app and click `Sync with Github`. 

Important: All `.md` files in your Github repo _must_ have metadata in the format shown above.

Important: All `.md` files in your Github repo _must_ have name `introduction.md` or `chapter-N.md`.

To make the content of a `.md` file _private_ (meaning a person must purchase the content to see it), remove `isFree:true`  and add `excerpt:""`. Add some excerpt content - this content is public and serves as a free preview.


## Add your own styles
To change the color scheme of this app, modify the `primary` and `secondary` theme colors inside `lib/context.js`. Select any colors from Material UI's official [color palette](https://material-ui-next.com/style/color/#color).

Recommended ways to add your own styles to this app:
1. [Inline style for a single element](#inline-style-for-a-single-element)
2. [Reusable style for multiple elements within single page or component](#reusable-style-for-multiple-elements-within-single-page-or-component)
3. [Reusable/importable style for multiple pages or components](#reusableimportable-style-for-multiple-pages-or-components)
4. [Global style for all pages in application](#global-style-for-all-pages-in-application)


### Inline style for a single element
USE CASE: apply a style to _one element_ on a single page/component <br>
For example, in our `book` page, we wrote this single inline style:
```
<p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  ...
</p>
```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/49116676e0894fcf00c33d208a284359b30f12bb/pages/book.js#L48)


### Reusable style for multiple elements within single page or component
USE CASE: apply the same style to _multiple elements_ on a single page/component.<br>
For example, in our `tutorials` page, we created `styleExcerpt` and applied it to a `<p>` element within the page:

```
const styleExcerpt = {
  margin: '0px 20px',
  opacity: '0.75',
  fontSize: '13px',
};

<p style={styleExcerpt}>
  ...
</p>

```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/49116676e0894fcf00c33d208a284359b30f12bb/pages/tutorials.js#L14)


### Reusable/importable style for multiple pages or components
USE CASE: apply the same style to elements on _multiple pages/components_.<br>
For example, we created `styleH1` inside `components/SharedStyles.js` and exported the style at the bottom of the file:
```
const styleH1 = {
  textAlign: 'center',
  fontWeight: '400',
  lineHeight: '45px',
};

module.exports = {
  styleH1,
};
```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/04c6cf78bee42455d48ef3466d868f2196381a57/components/SharedStyles.js#L48)

We then imported `styleH1` into our `book` page, as well as our `index` page, and applied the style to a `<h1>` element:
```
import {
  styleH1,
} from '../components/SharedStyles';

<h1 style={styleH1}>
  ...
</h1>
```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/49116676e0894fcf00c33d208a284359b30f12bb/pages/book.js#L13)


### Global style for all pages in application
USE CASE: apply the same style to elements on _all pages_ of your app.<br>
Create your style in `pages/_document.js`. For example, we specified a style for all hyperlinks that use the `<a>` element:
```
<style>
  {`
    a, a:focus {
      font-weight: 400;
      color: #1565C0;
      text-decoration: none;
      outline: none
    }
  `}
</style>
```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/49116676e0894fcf00c33d208a284359b30f12bb/pages/_document.js#L51)

We also specified styles for all content inside a `<body>` element:
```
<body
  style={{
    font: '16px Muli',
    color: '#222',
    margin: '0px auto',
    fontWeight: '400',
    lineHeight: '1.5em',
    backgroundColor: '#F7F9FC',
  }}
>
</body>
```
[See usage](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook/blob/49116676e0894fcf00c33d208a284359b30f12bb/pages/_document.js#L96)


## Deploy to Heroku

In this section we will learn how to deploy our app to [Heroku cloud](https://www.heroku.com/home). We will deploy our React-Next-Express app to lightweight Heroku container called [dyno](https://www.heroku.com/dynos).

Instructions are for app located at `/book/8-end`.
Adjust route if you are deploying app from the root of this public repo.

We will discuss the following topics in this section:
1. installing Heroku on Linux-based OS
2. creating app on Heroku dashboard
3. preparing app for deployment
4. configuring env variables
5. deploying app
6. checking logs
7. adding custom domain

Let's go step by step.

1. Install Heroku CLI (command-line interface) on your OS. Follow the [official guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). In this book we provide instructions for Linux-based systems, in particular, a Ubuntu OS. For Ubuntu OS, run in your terminal:
  <pre>sudo snap install --classic heroku</pre>
  To confirm a successful installation, run:
  <pre>heroku --version</pre>
  As example, my output that confirms successful installation, looks like:
  <pre>heroku/7.22.7 linux-x64 node-v11.10.1</pre>

2. [Sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) for Heroku, go to your Heroku dashboard and click purple <b>New</b> button on the right:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54558094-12b1f100-497a-11e9-94dd-d36399052931.png)

    On the next screen, give a name to your app and select a region. Click purple <b>Create app</b> button at the bottom:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54558276-8eac3900-497a-11e9-9026-25aa5047af87.png)

    You will be redirected to `Deploy` tab of your newly created Heroku app:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54558544-417c9700-497b-11e9-8885-6fdfde21c747.png)

3. As you can see from the above screenshot, you have two options. You can deploy the app directly from your local machine using Heroku CLI or directly from GitHub.
    In this tutorial, we will deploy a `builderbook/builderbook/book/8-end` app from our public [builderbook/builderbook](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook) repo hosted on GitHub. Deploying from a private repo will be a similar process.
    
    Deploying from GitHub has a few advantages. Heroku uses git to track changes in a codebase. It's possible to deploy app from the local machine using Heroku CLI, however you have to create a [Git repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) for `builderbook/builderbook/book/8-end` with `package.json` file at the root level. A first advantage is that we can deploy from a non-root folder using GitHub instead of Heroku CLI.
    
    A second advantage is automation, later on you can create a branch that automatically deploy every new commit to Heroku. For example, we have a [deploy branch](https://github.com/async-labs/saas/tree/deploy) for our demo for [SaaS boilerplate](https://github.com/async-labs/saas/). When we commit to `master` branch - there is no new deployment, when we commit to `deploy` branch - new change is automatically deployed to Heroku app.

    Let's set up deploying from GitHub. On `Deploy` tab of your Heroku app at Heroku dashboard, click <b>Connect to GitHub</b>, then search for your repo, then click <b>Connect</b> next to the name of the proper repo:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54560210-09775300-497f-11e9-9027-2e3850ec7ff1.png)

    If successful, you will see green text `Connected` and be offered to select a branch and deploy app automatically or manually. Automatic deployment will deploy every new commit, manual deployment requires you to manually click on <b>Deploy Branch</b> button. For simplicity, we will deploy manually from `master` branch of our `builderbook/builderbook` repo.

    Before we perform a manual deployment via GitHub, we need Heroku to run some additional code while app is being deploying. Firstly, we need to tell Heroku that `8-end` app in the `builderbook/builderbook` repo is not at the root level, it's actually nested at `/book/8-end`. Secondly, Heroku needs to know that our app is Node.js app so Heroku finds `package.json` file, properly installs dependencies and runs proper scripts (such as `build` and `start` scripts from `package.json`). To achieve this, we need to add so called `buildpacks` to our Heroku app. Click `Settings` tab, scroll to `Buildpacks` section and click purple <b>Add buildpack</b> button:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54561192-50fede80-4981-11e9-976a-c3d7c88527ec.png)

    Add two buildpacks, first is `https://github.com/timanovsky/subdir-heroku-buildpack` and second is `heroku/nodejs`:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54561577-30835400-4982-11e9-997f-4711d999808e.png)

    Next, scroll up while on `Settings` tab and click purple <b>Reveal Config Vars</b> button, create a new environmental variable `PROJECT_PATH` with value `book/8-end`:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54561775-a5568e00-4982-11e9-9561-2e5827873779.png)

    The above variable will be used by the first buildpack `subdir-heroku-buildpack` to deploy app from repo's subdirectory.

4. If we deploy app at this point, our app will deploy with errors since we did not add environmental variables. Similar to how you added `PROJECT_PATH` variable, add all environmental variables from `book/8-end/.env` file to your Heroku app. Remember to add the rest of env variables for all features to work, including signup event.

5. While on `Settings` tab, scroll to `Domains and certificates` section and note your app's URL. My app's URL is: https://builderbook-8-end.herokuapp.com
    Let's deploy, go to `Deploy` tab, scroll to `Manual deploy` section and click <b>Deploy branch</b> button.
    After deployment process is complete , navigate to your app's URL:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54564053-10569380-4988-11e9-87dd-f81a28dd6406.png)

6. Server logs are not available on Heroku dashboard. To see logs, you have to use Heroku CLI.
    In your terminal, run:
    <pre>heroku login</pre>

    Follow instructions to log in to Heroku CLI.

    After successful login, terminal will print:
    <pre>Logged in as email@domain.com</pre>

    Where `email@domain.com` is an email address that you used to create your Heroku account.

    To see logs, in your terminal run:
    <pre>heroku logs --app builderbook-8-end --tail</pre>

    In your terminal, you will see your most recent logs and be able to see a real-time logs. 

    You can output certain number of lines (N) for retrieved logs by adding `--num N` to the `heroku logs` command.
    You can print only app's logs by adding `--source app` or system's logs by adding `--source heroku`.  

7. Time to add a custom domain. The Heroku app that we created is deployed on `free dyno`. Free dyno plan does not let you to add a custom domain to your app. To add custom domain, go to `Resources` tab and click purple <b>Change Dyno Type</b> button:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54622849-983faa80-4a27-11e9-957f-54fe5aa742ca.png)

    Select a `Hobby` plan and click <b>Save</b> button.

    Navigate to `Settings` tab and scroll to the `Domains and certificates` and click purple <b>Add domain</b> button:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54623152-36cc0b80-4a28-11e9-974b-8a14fb56a86a.png)

    Type your custom domain name, I added `heroku.builderbook.org` as a custom domain, click <b>Save changes</b> button.

    Heroku will display you a value for CNAME record that you have to create for your custom domain. For me, custom domain is `heroku.builderbook.org and I manage DNS records at Now by Zeit.
    
    After you create a CNAME, ACM status on Heroku's dashboard will change to `Ok`:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10218864/54624195-2452d180-4a2a-11e9-999d-a6a771cde73c.png)

It's important that you remember to manually add your custom domain to the settings of your Google OAuth app (Chapter 3) and GitHub OAuth app (Chapter 6). If you forget to do it, you will see errors when you try to log in to your app or when you try to connect GitHub to your app.

## Scaling

You may want to consider splitting single Next/Express server into two servers:
- Next server for serving pages, server-side caching, sitemap and robots
- Express server for internal and external APIs

Here is an example of web application with split servers:
https://github.com/async-labs/saas

Splitting servers will get you:
- faster page loads since Next rendering does not block internal and external APIs,
- faster code reload times during development,
- faster deployment and more flexible scaling of individual apps.
